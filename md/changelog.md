## v6.6.0
### Prominence
This update contains updates to Distant Horizons that enable clients to request LOD data from the server for chunks that are outside of the server render distance. This means that you will be able to distant chunks without first having to traverse to them. The server will also generate yet-to-be-generated chunks on-demand as the LOD data is being requested. Additionally, Iris, Sodium and the Complementary shader pack have been updated to increase performance and Advanced Colored Lighting has been enabled. Also, performance libraries were added that should slightly improve chunk generation times. Finally, the Quilt framework has been updated to v28.
